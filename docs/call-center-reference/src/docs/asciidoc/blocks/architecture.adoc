= Technological Stack
This solution is going to be built using Spring Boot 2.0.1 as a web and REST framework for the backend, using Java 9 as the JDK.

== Project Structure
The _Src_ folder follows the _Maven_ project structure which holds the 
_java_ and _test_ folders. They contain the following _Java_ packages:

* *com.csoftz.almundo.call.center.api:* The REST controller classes.
* *com.csoftz.almundo.call.center.common:* Contains the cross-cutting classes used by all other modules in the system.
* *com.csoftz.almundo.call.center.concurrent:* Classes about the Runnable or concurrent programming involved in Central Call Center application.
* *com.csoftz.almundo.call.center.domain:* Classes to model the problem world.
* *com.csoftz.almundo.call.center.service:* Classes to act as services (injected as dependencies).
* *com.csoftz.almundo.call.center.CallCenterApplication:* Spring Boot main entry class for execution.

The project has three REST end-points to allow you to see information. They are as follows:

* */api/v1/employee/all* to view all registered employees
* /api/v1/call-center/make/call/123* to make a call for phone number 123
* /api/v1/call-center/simulate/multiple/calls/10* To simulate a 10 incoming calls.
