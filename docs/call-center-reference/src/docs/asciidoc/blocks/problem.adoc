= Problem 
There is a call center where there are three types of employees: operator, supervisor and director. The 
process of attending a telephone call in the first instance must be attended by an operator, 
if there is not a free one, it must be attended by a supervisor, and if there are not free supervisors, 
it must be attended by a director.

== Requirements
The system must adhere to the following rules:

* Design the modeling of classes and the UML diagrams needed to document and communicate the design.
* There must be a Dispatcher class that handles the calls, and must contain the dispatchCall method to 
assign them to available employees.
* The Dispatcher class must have the ability to process ten calls at the same time (concurrently).
* Each call can last a random time between five and ten seconds.
* It must have a unit test where it processes ten calls.

== Extras
* Give a solution when a incoming call cannot be attended as all employees are busy.
* Give a solution when 10 concurrent incoming calls are being attended.
* Add all necessary unit tests.
* Add source code documentation.
